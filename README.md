# Twitter-tweet-rating

## 
Introduction:
This project focused on wrangling and analyzing data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account using Python and its libraries, documented in a Jupyter Notebook. This Twitter account rates dogs with humorous commentary. The rating denominator is usually 10; however, the numerators are usually greater than 10. We wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded the Twitter archive for us to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets. Additional data is gathered using Twitter's API.
